# Barricade
Barricade is a firewall application that acts as a network security system.
The motivation behind this project comes from our passion towards how hacking works and how to find ways to prevent it.
Barricade uses Python to blocks certain networks, ports, IP addresses, and ping attacks that are specified in a json file
